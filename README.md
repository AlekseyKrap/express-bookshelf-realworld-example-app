## intent

This project was created in order to familiarise myself with some key technologies in use at my day job. It's not intended to be production ready, but PRs that address this and any other issues are welcome!

## getting started

Ensure [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) is installed, then:

1.  Clone this repo.
2.  Change to the above dir.
3.  Run `yarn docker:start` to start the app.

## running tests

Run the full test suite with:

```
$ yarn docker:test
```

CLI args will be passed through to Jest. For example, to run in watch mode:

```
$ yarn docker:test --watch
```

This project also passes the [realworld-server-tester](https://github.com/agrison/realworld-server-tester) test suite. First start the server:

```
$ yarn docker:start
```

Then in a new terminal window, assuming you've cloned the `realworld-server-tester` repo and changed to the correct directory, run:

```
$ java -jar target/realworld-server-tester-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar http://localhost:3000/api
```

## implementation details

High-level overview of some important decisions made building the app. Check the code comments for more detail too.

### structure

#### group by coupling

The general rule with modules in the `lib/` dir is "things that change together, stay together". This is largely a personal preference after having to maintain apps that instead group by function, but the approach is also summarised nicely in this [express code structure](https://github.com/focusaurus/express_code_structure) example.

Each module is usually an Express sub-app. Code that is shared across modules is either promoted (e.g. middleware), or is added to a specific app-wide registry (e.g. models).

#### initializers

The initialization procedure is based on [the approach taken by the Locomotive framework](http://www.locomotivejs.org/guide/initialization/). App initialization steps have been split into separate functions in
the `initializers/` folder, and are run in a certain order. Any required app-wide references are set on the [`app.locals`](https://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#app.locals) object.

### configuration

Configuration is handled by [node-convict](https://github.com/mozilla/node-convict), which provides context on each setting and enables validation and early failures for when the configuration is wrong.

Some values are required, and there are also some defaults which can be overridden if required. You can do this via environment-specific configuration files, for example `development.json` and `test.json`. Environment variables are also respected, see [precedence order](https://github.com/mozilla/node-convict#precendence-order) for more information.

### testing

#### outside-in

The preference is to create high-level tests first in order to test the API end-to-end from a userâ€™s perspective. From there we can drop down into lower-level tests like unit tests (this hasn't yet been done in this repo). See [Testing from the Outside-In](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/testing-from-the-outsidein) for more information.

#### run in band

Since we're hitting a real DB via our functional tests, we want to run them serially in the current process using Jest's [`runInBand`](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/cli.html#runinband) option so they remain isolated. If the test suite gets expanded to include unit tests that don't hit the DB for example, then we may want to be specific about when we use that flag in order to keep the tests running as fast as possible.

#### prefer snapshot tests

Where possible Jest's [snapshot testing](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/snapshot-testing.html) feature is used in order to validate key parts of the API response. Where this is not straightforward, for example when the response returns creation dates which vary over time, we've fallen back to more specific assertions.
